I couldn't get past step one because I could not figure out how to properly use "loc"
The "Rewind" telling me lesson 4.4.3, 4.5.6, 4.7.6 had no information on how to properly use "loc"
I watched the video in the hint on "loc", but it was specific case where the values were integers and not strings, so I couldn't apply it to this problem
I went through the provided documentation on "loc" and I couldn't tell how a compare oprator could be used to filter on strings
I would really like an extension on this one
